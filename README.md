# Churn-Prediction-for-Telecommunications-Customers-Using-Artificial-Neural-Networks-ANN-

This repository contains a project dedicated to predicting customer churn in the telecommunications sector using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The project focuses on building and training a robust ANN model to identify customers likely to churn, helping telecom companies to proactively retain them. I have used leverage extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced neural network techniques to achieve high accuracy and performance.
